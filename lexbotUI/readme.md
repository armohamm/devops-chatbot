Generic widget UI to integrate lex bot in any web app.

In order to make it work : 
  - Insert bundle.css and bundle.js from the dist folder into your main html file
  - Create a div with id="lexbotapp"
  - Instantiate the chatbot with  new LexBot(IdentityPoolRegion, IdentityPoolId, WidgetHeight, WidgetWidht);
